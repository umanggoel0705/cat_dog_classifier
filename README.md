# cat_dog_classifier
The Cat and Dog Classification dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that involves classifying photos as either containing a dog or a cat. This dataset is provided as a subset of photos from a much larger dataset of approximately 25 thousands.

The dataset contains 24,998 images, split into 12,499 Cat images and 12,499 Dog images. The training images are divided equally between cat and dog images, while the test images are not labeled. This allows users to evaluate their models on unseen data.
